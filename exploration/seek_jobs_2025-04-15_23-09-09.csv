a SaaS product to the next level. This role leans heavily on your Laravel expertise but will have you working across the full stack – from building front-end experiences to making sure the back-end is solid, secure, and scalable.

As a Senior you'd have plenty of ownership, the chance to guide and mentor others, and the opportunity to work on products that are genuinely making an impact.
  
The role in a nutshell

Adding value to the design and development of new features and improvements across their SaaS platform.
Back-end development using Laravel (we're big on writing clean, maintainable code).
Building out modern front-ends with React or Vue.js.
Working with APIs, databases, and third-party integrations to create seamless, reliable systems.
Keeping an eye on performance, security, and scalability – and jumping in to fix issues when they pop up.
Work closely with the team to turn ideas into real features, help others level up through code reviews and advice, and keep an eye on the bigger picture to make sure everyone is building things the right way without piling up tech debt.
About you
4+ years of full stack development experience with a strong focus on Laravel, PHP, and SQL databases.
Solid front-end skills with React or Vue.js, plus experience building and integrating RESTful APIs.
Comfortable with Git, Docker, and AWS (or eager to learn), and familiar with modern dev workflows.
Strong communication skills – you're just as comfortable chatting with stakeholders as you are reviewing pull requests.
Proactive and self-driven – you don’t wait to be told what to do next.
Any of the below would be great but don't stress...

Experience with serverless architecture (e.g., Lambda) and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).
Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and modern DevOps practices.
Exposure to Typescript/Node.js backend development.
Previous experience mentoring junior devs or leading small teams.
If you love problem-solving, enjoy collaborating with a smart, friendly team, and like seeing your ideas come to life in production, this could be a great fit.
